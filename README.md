## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a study timer made with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. Simple ingredients, effective product, lots of fun behind the scenes making the code object oriented, and dealing with integrating time intervals into the functionality.

## Lessons Learned:

Although the logic for a double stopwatch is relatively straight forward, dealing with time and changing targets within the DOM definitely taught me a lot about memory assignment. Also that checkboxes are a total pain to attempt to style :D
